# Azure Identity & Access Mini-Lab (Microsoft Entra ID)

## Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on experience with **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)**, focusing on cloud identity and access management.

The lab is designed to reflect a **university IT environment**, similar to **Acadia University**, where faculty, staff, students, and IT administrators require different access levels, security controls, and monitoring.

This project serves as a **starter identity lab** and provides a strong foundation for future work with **Hybrid Active Directory, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft 365 administration**.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)
- Azure Portal
- Conditional Access / Security Defaults
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

---

## 1. Entra ID Tenant Setup
An Entra ID tenant was created and reviewed to represent the organization’s **identity boundary**, where all users, roles, and security policies are managed centrally.

## 2. User Management
Cloud users were created to represent common roles found in a university environment:
- IT Administrator  
- IT Support  
- Faculty/Staff  
- Student  

Password policies were configured, and users were required to change their password at first sign-in to improve security.

## 3. Security Groups
Security groups were created to support **group-based access control**, allowing permissions and policies to be applied efficiently and at scale.

Groups created:
- `IT_Admins`
- `Faculty_Staff`
- `Students`

Users were assigned to groups based on their organizational role.

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Administrative roles were assigned following the **principle of least privilege** to reduce security risk.

Roles assigned:
- **User Administrator** – IT Support account  
- **Global Reader** – Read-only administrative access  

Global Administrator access was intentionally kept limited.

## 5. Security Configuration (MFA Enforcement)
Privileged accounts were secured by enforcing **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** using Conditional Access or Security Defaults.

This helps protect administrative accounts from credential compromise.

## 6. Authentication Monitoring (Sign-In Logs)
Sign-in logs were reviewed to verify successful authentication, MFA enforcement, and Conditional Access outcomes.

This is essential for troubleshooting access issues and identifying suspicious sign-in activity.

## 7. Administrative Monitoring (Audit Logs)
Audit logs were reviewed to track administrative actions such as:
- User creation  
- Group membership changes  
- Role assignments  
- Security policy updates

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Cloud identity management  
- Group-based access control  
- Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Least-privilege security model  
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
- Identity monitoring and troubleshooting  

---

## Why This Project Is Relevant
This project reflects real-world identity administration tasks performed by **Systems Administrators** in a university environment, including:
- Managing faculty, staff, and student identities  
- Securing privileged administrative accounts  
- Monitoring authentication and administrative activity  
- Preparing for hybrid identity integration  

---

## Next Steps
This lab will be expanded to include:
- On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)  
- Azure AD Connect (Hybrid Identity)  
- Microsoft Intune device management  
- Microsoft 365 user and license administration  
- PowerShell automation for identity tasks
