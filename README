# Azure Identity & Access Mini-Lab (Microsoft Entra ID)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on experience with **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)**, focusing on identity and access management in a cloud environment.

The lab is designed to reflect a **university IT environment**, similar to **Acadia University**, where faculty, staff, students, and IT administrators require different access levels and security controls.

This project serves as a **starter identity lab** and forms the foundation for future expansion into **Hybrid Active Directory, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft 365 administration**.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)
- Azure Portal
- Conditional Access / Security Defaults
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

---

## 1. Entra ID Tenant Setup
An Entra ID tenant was created and reviewed to represent the organization’s **identity boundary**, where all users, roles, and security policies are managed.

---

## 2. User Management
Cloud users were created to represent common roles in a university environment:
- IT Administrator
- IT Support
- Faculty/Staff
- Student  

Password policies were configured and users were required to change their password at first sign-in.

## 3. Security Groups
Security groups were created to enable **group-based access control**, allowing permissions and policies to scale efficiently.

Groups created:
- `IT_Admins`
- `Faculty_Staff`
- `Students`

Users were assigned to groups based on their organizational role.

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Administrative roles were assigned following the **principle of least privilege** to reduce security risk.

Roles assigned:
- **User Administrator** – IT Support account
- **Global Reader** – Read-only administrative access  
Global Administrator access was kept limited.

## 5. Security Configuration (MFA Enforcement)
Privileged accounts were secured by enforcing **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** using Conditional Access or Security Defaults.

This ensures administrative accounts are protected against credential compromise.

## 6. Authentication Monitoring (Sign-in Logs)
Sign-in logs were reviewed to verify successful authentication, MFA enforcement, and Conditional Access results.

This is critical for troubleshooting access issues and detecting suspicious activity.

## 7. Administrative Monitoring (Audit Logs)
Audit logs were reviewed to track administrative actions such as:
- User creation
- Group membership changes
- Role assignments
- Security policy updates

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Cloud identity management
- Group-based access control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Least privilege security model
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Identity monitoring and troubleshooting

---

## Why This Project Is Relevant
This project reflects real-world identity administration tasks performed by **Systems Administrators** in a university environment, including:
- Managing faculty, staff, and student identities
- Securing privileged administrative accounts
- Monitoring authentication and administrative activity
- Preparing for hybrid identity integration

---

## Next Steps
This lab will be expanded to include:
- On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Azure AD Connect (Hybrid Identity)
- Microsoft Intune device management
- Microsoft 365 user and license administration
- PowerShell automation for identity tasks
