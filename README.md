# Azure Identity & Access Mini-Lab (Microsoft Entra ID)

## 🧩 Identity Architecture Summary

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="ChatGPT Image Jan 28, 2026, 05_09_47 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f49f92ec-2ca8-4548-bea7-474ca2266d1e" />


This project demonstrates a **cloud-based identity and access management environment** using **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)**, modeled after a **university IT organization**.

A centralized **Entra ID tenant** acts as the identity boundary where users, security groups, administrative roles, and security policies are managed. Cloud users were created to represent **students, faculty/staff, IT support, and IT administrators**, each assigned appropriate access through **group-based membership** and **role-based access control (RBAC)**.

Administrative privileges were delegated using **least-privilege principles**, with roles such as *User Administrator* and *Global Reader* assigned instead of broad Global Administrator access.

Security posture was strengthened through **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** enforcement using **Security Defaults / Conditional Access**, protecting privileged accounts from credential compromise.

Authentication activity and administrative changes were monitored using **Sign-In Logs** and **Audit Logs**, enabling visibility into:
- User authentication attempts and MFA enforcement  
- Role assignments and group membership changes  
- Identity-related administrative actions  

Together, these components demonstrate **end-to-end cloud identity administration**, security enforcement, and monitoring workflows aligned with real-world university and enterprise IT environments.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)
- Azure Portal
- Conditional Access / Security Defaults
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

---

## 1. Entra ID Tenant Setup
An Entra ID tenant was created and reviewed to represent the organization’s **identity boundary**, where all users, roles, and security policies are managed centrally.

**Tenant Overview**

---

## 2. User Management
Cloud users were created to represent common roles found in a university environment:
- IT Administrator  
- IT Support  
- Faculty/Staff  
- Student  

Password policies were configured, and users were required to change their password at first sign-in to improve security.

**Users List**

**Individual User Profile**

---

## 3. Security Groups
Security groups were created to support **group-based access control**, allowing permissions and policies to be applied efficiently and at scale.

Groups created:
- `IT_Admins`
- `Faculty_Staff`
- `Students`

Users were assigned to groups based on their organizational role.

**Groups Overview**

**IT_Admins Group Membership**

---

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Administrative roles were assigned following the **principle of least privilege** to reduce security risk.

Roles assigned:
- **User Administrator** – IT Support account  
- **Global Reader** – Read-only administrative access  

Global Administrator access was intentionally kept limited.

**User Administrator Role Assignment**

**Global Reader Role Assignment**

---

## 5. Security Configuration (MFA Enforcement)
Privileged accounts were secured by enforcing **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** using Conditional Access or Security Defaults.

This helps protect administrative accounts from credential compromise.

**Conditional Access / Security Defaults**

---

## 6. Authentication Monitoring (Sign-In Logs)
Sign-in logs were reviewed to verify successful authentication, MFA enforcement, and Conditional Access outcomes.

This is essential for troubleshooting access issues and identifying suspicious sign-in activity.

**Sign-In Logs**

---

## 7. Administrative Monitoring (Audit Logs)
Audit logs were reviewed to track administrative actions such as:
- User creation  
- Group membership changes  
- Role assignments  
- Security policy updates  

**Audit Logs**
*Add Members*

*Add User*

- Least-privilege security model  
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
- Identity monitoring and troubleshooting  

---

## Why This Project Is Relevant
This project reflects real-world identity administration tasks performed by **Systems Administrators** in a university environment, including:
- Managing faculty, staff, and student identities  
- Securing privileged administrative accounts  
- Monitoring authentication and administrative activity  
- Preparing for hybrid identity integration  

---

## Next Steps
This lab will be expanded to include:
- On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)  
- Azure AD Connect (Hybrid Identity)
